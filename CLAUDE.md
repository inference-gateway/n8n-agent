# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

n8n-agent is an A2A (Agent-to-Agent) server implementing the [A2A Protocol](https://github.com/inference-gateway/adk) for agent-to-agent communication. A2A agent server specialized in generating and automating n8n workflows. The project is automatically generated from ADL (Agent Definition Language) specifications defined in `agent.yaml`.

## Core Architecture

### ADL-Generated Structure

The codebase is generated using ADL CLI 0.54.0 and follows a strict generation pattern:
- **Generated Files**: Marked with `DO NOT EDIT` headers - manual changes will be overwritten
- **Configuration Source**: `agent.yaml` - defines agent capabilities, skills, and metadata
- **Server Implementation**: Built on the ADK (Agent Development Kit) framework from `github.com/inference-gateway/adk`

### Key Components

- **Main Entry Point**: `main.go` - A cobra-based CLI. The root command exposes
  `--version` and `--help`; the `start` subcommand boots the A2A server with:
  - OpenAI-compatible LLM client configuration
  - Agent builder with system prompt from `agent.yaml`
  - A2A server with streaming and background task handlers
  - Graceful shutdown handling

- **Agent Configuration**: `.well-known/agent-card.json` - Serves agent metadata at runtime
- **Environment Configuration**: Extensive env vars with `A2A_` prefix (see CONFIGURATIONS.md for full list)

## Development Commands

```bash
# Generate/regenerate code from ADL specification
task generate

# Run the agent in development mode (debug enabled, port 8080)
task run

# Run tests (note: no tests currently exist)
task test
task test:cover  # with coverage

# Code quality
task lint         # Run golangci-lint
task fmt          # Format code with go fmt

# Build
task build        # Creates bin/n8n-agent
task docker:build # Build Docker image

# Clean build artifacts
task clean
```

## Testing Individual Components

```bash
# Run specific test file (when tests are added)
go test -v ./path/to/package -run TestFunctionName

# Debug with A2A Debugger
docker run --rm -it --network host ghcr.io/inference-gateway/a2a-debugger:latest \
  --server-url http://localhost:8080 tasks submit "Your query"
```

## LLM Provider Configuration

The agent uses OpenAI-compatible LLM client. Configure with:
- `A2A_AGENT_CLIENT_PROVIDER`: `openai`, `anthropic`, `azure`, `ollama`, `deepseek`
- `A2A_AGENT_CLIENT_MODEL`: Model identifier
- `A2A_AGENT_CLIENT_API_KEY`: Provider API key
- `A2A_AGENT_CLIENT_BASE_URL`: Custom endpoint (optional)

## Adding New Functionality

### Tools (function-call)
The following tools are currently defined:
- **Read** (built-in): Read a file from disk. Returns its contents, optionally sliced by line offset/limit. Use this to load SKILL.md bodies on demand.
- **search_n8n_docs**: Search through N8N node documentation to find relevant information about specific nodes, their parameters, and usage patterns
- **validate_n8n_workflow**: Validate N8N workflow YAML/JSON to ensure it follows the correct schema and has all required attributes before creating artifacts

To modify tools:
1. Update `agent.yaml` `spec.tools` with tool definitions
2. Run `task generate` to regenerate the codebase
3. Implement tool logic in the generated `tools/` files (look for TODO placeholders)
4. Write tests for each tool

### Skills (markdown system-prompt playbooks)
The following skills are currently shipped with the agent:
- **n8n-workflow-generation** (bare scaffold): Use this when the user requests a new n8n workflow or asks to automate a process. Searches relevant nodes with search_n8n_docs, drafts the workflow YAML, validates it with validate_n8n_workflow, then saves it via create_artifact.
- **n8n-workflow-validation** (bare scaffold): Use this to validate an n8n workflow before saving it as an artifact, or whenever a user asks to check, lint, or validate an existing workflow. Runs validate_n8n_workflow, fixes every reported error, and re-validates until the workflow is VALID. Validation is mandatory before create_artifact.

Each skill lives in its own directory at `.agents/skills/<id>/SKILL.md`
and is loaded into the system prompt at startup. A generated `.claude/skills`
-> `../.agents/skills` symlink makes the same tree readable as `.claude/skills/<id>/SKILL.md`,
so Claude Code picks these skills up directly. Bare skills can ship arbitrary
bundled assets (scripts, templates, resources) alongside `SKILL.md` -
the whole `.agents/skills/<id>/` directory is protected by `.adl-ignore` against
regeneration overwrites. To modify skills:
1. Update `agent.yaml` `spec.skills` with skill definitions
2. Run `task generate` (registry skills are re-fetched; bare skill
   directories are preserved when listed in `.adl-ignore`)
3. For bare skills, edit `.agents/skills/<id>/SKILL.md` directly - frontmatter
   (`name`/`description`/`tags`) shows up on the agent card. Drop helper
   scripts or templates next to it (e.g. `.agents/skills/<id>/scripts/foo.py`).

### Modifying Agent Behavior

- **System Prompt**: Edit in `agent.yaml`, then regenerate
- **Capabilities**: Modify in `agent.yaml` (streaming, pushNotifications, stateTransitionHistory)
- **Server Configuration**: Update environment variables or `agent.yaml` server section

## Testing Strategy

When implementing tests:
- Create `*_test.go` files alongside implementation files
- Use table-driven tests for comprehensive coverage
- Mock external dependencies (LLM client, Redis if used)
- Test A2A protocol compliance with integration tests

## Environment Management

### Development Environment
- **Flox Environment**: ✅ Configured via `.flox/env/manifest.toml` providing Go 1.26.4, linter, `go-task`, Docker, and the Claude Code CLI. Activate with `flox activate`.

## Important Constraints

- **Generated Files**: Never manually edit files with "DO NOT EDIT" headers
- **Configuration Changes**: Always modify `agent.yaml` and regenerate
- **ADL Version**: Ensure ADL CLI 0.54.0 or compatible version for regeneration
- **Port Configuration**: Default 8080, configurable via `A2A_PORT` or `A2A_SERVER_PORT`

## Debugging Tips

- Enable debug mode: `A2A_DEBUG=true`
- Check health: `GET /health`
- View agent metadata: `GET /.well-known/agent-card.json`
- Monitor streaming updates: Set `A2A_STREAMING_STATUS_UPDATE_INTERVAL`
- Use A2A Debugger container for interactive testing
